## Solve frustrating Figma problems, Simply!
We're a passion project of @themizarkshow using a lot of the Figma starter templates and remixing them to create simple widgets and plugins that work consistently across the tools (design files and whiteboard files). 

* Simple Notes & Notations = get your thoughts onto the canvas
* Simple Changelogs = document changes as you make them, not later
* Simple Reactions = allow reactions and voting with 1 widget
* Simple Pointing = run planning poker sessions in your design tool
* Plus... we've been releasing Figjam Templates as well!

This project is a slow-burn but we hope to make your life easier and keep Figma the place where designers go first and foremost so that our work doesn't splinter across a half-dozen tools that each want $15 a month.
